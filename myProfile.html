    <h2 style="color: green;">The version of myself during my time at the University...</h2>
    <p>When I entered the University, I chose Chemistry as my major because I consistently achieved top scores
        among my peers. However, as I progressed to the second semester of my first year, everything became
        overwhelming. I rarely managed to pass most of my classes, especially the core ones related to my major.
        <br>
        Despite the challenges, what kept me going on this academic journey was the support of my close friends.
        They stood by me during times when I struggled to maintain my passion for studying and pursuing my degree.

    <h2 style="color: peru;">The version of myself during my time of working at the first company...</h2>
    <p style="border: 4px dashed orange;">I began my first career at a company where I worked in the Purchasing field. A
        significant
        part of my daily
        responsibilities involved handling the quality checks for materials supplied, which fell under my scope. In
        addition
        to this, I regularly developed strategies for negotiation and conducted market research to determine the price
        trends of the materials I handled.
        <br>
        However, as time passed, I found that the tasks assigned by my supervisor became tedious and lacked
        the challenge I sought. Eventually, I made the decision to resign from the position.

    <h2 style="color:blue;">The version of myself during my time in the second position at work...</h2>
    <p style="border: 4px dashed deepskyblue;">
        After quiting the previous job, I received an offer to work as a tutor for a certain period with elementary and
        junior high school students. I really enjoyed teaching and
        making sure
        my students learned effectively. Also, what I loved most about my classes was how engaged and enthusiastic
        the students were.
        It was so motivating, and made me do my best as well as run the classes smoothly.

    <h2 style="color: darkmagenta;">The last version of myself...</h2>
    <p style="border: 4px dashed gray">
        As I wanted a job where I could work from anywhere. So, I started thinking about changing careers. I decided
        to
        learn
        how to code, even though I didn't know anything about it. At first, I struggled with a course I got from Udemy.
        After a few months, I got the hang of the basics. Then a friend told me about the JSD Bootcamp. I completed all
        the assessments and got in, aiming to become a full-stack web developer in the next 4-5 months.
