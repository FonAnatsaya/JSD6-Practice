    <h2>The version of myself during my time at the University...</h2>
    <p>When I entered the University, I chose Chemistry as my major because I consistently achieved top scores
        among my peers. However, as I progressed to the second semester of my first year, everything became
        overwhelming. I rarely managed to pass most of my classes, especially the core ones related to my major.
        <br>
        Despite the challenges, what kept me going on this academic journey was the support of my close friends.
        They stood by me during times when I struggled to maintain my passion for studying and pursuing my degree.
