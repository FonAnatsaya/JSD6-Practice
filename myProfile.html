    <h2>The version of myself during my time at the University...</h2>
    <p>When I entered the University, I chose Chemistry as my major because I consistently achieved top scores
        among my peers. However, as I progressed to the second semester of my first year, everything became
        overwhelming. I rarely managed to pass most of my classes, especially the core ones related to my major.
        <br>
        Despite the challenges, what kept me going on this academic journey was the support of my close friends.
        They stood by me during times when I struggled to maintain my passion for studying and pursuing my degree.

    <h2 style="color: peru;">The version of myself during my time of working at the first company...</h2>
    <p style="border: 4px dashed orange;">I began my first career at a company where I worked in the Purchasing field. A
        significant
        part of my daily
        responsibilities involved handling the quality checks for materials supplied, which fell under my scope. In
        addition
        to this, I regularly developed strategies for negotiation and conducted market research to determine the price
        trends of the materials I handled.
        <br>
        However, as time passed, I found that the tasks assigned by my supervisor became tedious and lacked
        the challenge I sought. Eventually, I made the decision to resign from the position.
